# Critical Error Fixes Summary

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve the critical errors in the PDF processing and storage system.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Supabase Storage RLS Policy Violations

**Problem**: `StorageApiError: new row violates row-level security policy`

**Root Cause**: The RLS policies were using `storage.foldername(name)[1]` which doesn't work with the file path structure being used (`resumes/filename.pdf`).

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated RLS policies in `setup-database.sql` to use `split_part(name, '/', 1)` instead of `storage.foldername(name)[1]`
- Modified `uploadResume()` function in `src/lib/supabase.ts` to use user ID as folder structure: `{user_id}/{filename}.pdf`
- This ensures the file path matches the RLS policy expectations

**Files Modified**:
- `setup-database.sql`: Updated storage policies
- `src/lib/supabase.ts`: Fixed file path structure

### 2. AI Response Parsing Failures

**Problem**: `Failed to parse AI response: SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'O', "Okay, so I"... is not valid JSON`

**Root Cause**: Together.ai was returning responses with `<think>` tags and explanatory text instead of pure JSON.

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced the AI prompt in `src/lib/ai.ts` to explicitly demand JSON-only responses
- Improved response cleaning logic to better handle `<think>` tags and non-JSON content
- Added more robust JSON extraction that looks for the first `{` and last `}`
- Added better error handling when no JSON structure is found

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/ai.ts`: Enhanced prompt and response parsing

### 3. Database Schema Issues

**Problem**: `Failed to create site: Could not find the 'name' column of 'sites' in the schema cache`

**Root Cause**: The `sites` table was not created in the database.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added the complete `sites` table schema to `setup-database.sql`
- Included all necessary RLS policies for the sites table
- The table now supports multiple sites per user with proper constraints

**Files Modified**:
- `setup-database.sql`: Added sites table and policies

## Technical Details

### Storage Policy Fix
```sql
-- Before (broken)
create policy "Users can upload their own resumes" on storage.objects
  for insert with check (bucket_id = 'resumes' and auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

-- After (working)
create policy "Users can upload their own resumes" on storage.objects
  for insert with check (bucket_id = 'resumes' and auth.uid()::text = split_part(name, '/', 1));
```

### File Path Structure
```javascript
// Before
const filePath = `resumes/${fileName}`; // resumes/uuid-timestamp.pdf

// After  
const filePath = `${user.id}/${fileName}`; // uuid/timestamp.pdf
```

### AI Prompt Enhancement
```javascript
// Added explicit instructions
const prompt = `CRITICAL: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any thinking, explanations, or additional text.

Rules:
- Do NOT include any thinking tags, explanations, or additional text
- Respond with ONLY the JSON object
...`
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Database Setup**: Run the updated `setup-database.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
2. **Test PDF Upload**: Try uploading a PDF resume - should now work without RLS violations
3. **Test AI Processing**: The AI should now return clean JSON without parsing errors
4. **Test Site Creation**: Creating sites should work with the new sites table

## Next Steps

1. Run the database setup script in Supabase
2. Test the PDF upload functionality
3. Verify AI processing works correctly
4. Confirm site creation functionality

All critical errors should now be resolved with these fixes.
